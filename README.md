This project aims to develop machine learning features in SCILAB, which will be available to the end-user as a toolbox or direct function calls. The project has been divided into two sections

 * all major machine learning algorithms will be implemented through Scilab code.
 * an integration approach will be followed to adapt popular ml library Tensorflow for SCILAB, using PIMS

ml libraries to be adapted from python to Scilab-

 * Scikit-learn
 
Major approach being followed is integration of Jupyter_client within Scilab, using a remote IPython kernel.
 
## Requirements (Getting Started)

The toolbox requires the user to have the following softwares and packages to be installed:
 * Scilab 6.0.0 with scipython toolbox
 * Python 2.7 with numpy and scipy
 * Jupyter_client, notebook
 * Ipython kernel

On the remote server side
 * Python 2.7 with numpy and scipy
 * Jupyter notebook
 * Ipython
 * Scikit-learn 
 * Datasets
